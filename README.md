# Experimental Dataset Construction

The datasets used for 1-order, 2-order, and 3-order recommendation are constructed based on the cloud API invocation information of mashups.

For example, given a mashup and the cloud APIs it invokes as shown below:

| Mashup        | Invoked cloud APIs |
|----| -- |
| TravelAssist  |Twitter, OpenWeather, Google Maps, Yelp|

Based on this mashup, we can construct datasets for 1-order, 2-order, and 3-order recommendation as follows.

| 1-order Recommendation Dataset               |
|----------------------------------------------|
| (Twitter) → (OpenWeather, Google Maps, Yelp) |
| (OpenWeather) → (Twitter, Google Maps, Yelp) |
| (Google Maps) → (Twitter, OpenWeather, Yelp) |
| (Yelp) → (Twitter, OpenWeather, Google Maps) |

| 2-order Recommendation Dataset                |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| (Twitter, OpenWeather) → (Google Maps, Yelp)  |
| (Twitter, Google Maps) → (OpenWeather, Yelp)  |
| (Twitter, Yelp) → (OpenWeather, Google Maps)  |
| (OpenWeather, Google Maps) → (Twitter, Yelp)  |
| (OpenWeather, Yelp) → (Twitter, Google Maps)  |
| (Google Maps, Yelp) → (Twitter, OpenWeather)  |

| 3-order Recommendation Dataset               |
|----------------------------------------------|
| (Twitter, OpenWeather, Google Maps) → (Yelp) |
| (OpenWeather, Google Maps, Yelp) → (Twitter) |
| (Twitter, Google Maps, Yelp) → (OpenWeather) |
| (Twitter, OpenWeather, Yelp) → (Google Maps) |
